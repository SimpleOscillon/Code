FUNCTION DESCRIPTION

    Treating only the fundamental mode as non-perturbative, calculates the
    power radiated by the higher harmonics if the configuration is
    linearly stable. Stores the output as PowerVsOmega = [OmegaList
    PowerList].

INPUT DESCRIPTION

    Radius = Physical size of the S1 grid. If Radius is chosen too large, then
    there may not be enough precision to satisfy the boundary conditions.

    RadiusRad = Physical size of the grid on which the radiation is
    calculated. Generally, we must have RadiusRad â‰¥ Radius. Outside of
    Radius, S1 is taken to be identically zero.

    dr = Physical size of the lattice spacing. 

    Vcoeff = The potential coefficients, whose sum must be less than or
    equal to 1.

    NHarmonics = Number of harmonics to calculate.

    OmegaList = List of the physical frequencies of the oscillon at which
    to compute the output power.
