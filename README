Code to compute the properties of the oscillon in the PQB formalism. 
The folders Matlab and Python contain equivalent versions of the procedure outlined in the paper arXiv:.

The caclulators are restricted to work with one non-perturbative harmonic in order to maximize ease-of-use and speed.
In order to do more precise calculations in the PQB formalism, the user is encouraged to read appendix A of arXiv:.
